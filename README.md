## üöÄ Projects Overview

### 1. **Boston Housing Dataset - Price Prediction**  
A classic regression task using the Boston Housing dataset to predict housing prices based on various features such as the number of rooms, the crime rate in the area, and accessibility to highways.

- **Key Aspects**:  
  - Data Preprocessing
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Selection & Training
  - Evaluation Metrics (R¬≤, RMSE)
  - Hyperparameter Tuning

### 2. **Car Price Prediction - CarDekho Dataset**  
In this project, we predict the selling prices of cars using features like the car model, year of purchase, fuel type, and kilometers driven. The dataset is sourced from **CarDekho**, a well-known Indian car portal.

- **Key Aspects**:  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Data Cleaning
  - Feature Selection & Encoding
  - Regression Model Implementation (Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression)
  - Model Evaluation
